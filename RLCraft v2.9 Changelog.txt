RLCraft v2.9 - Quests, Hats, Cave Update, Nether Update, Update Update I Literally Can't Remember Everything We Updated Because We Updated So Much !@#$ Holy %^&* Update

This update has been over a year in the making, thank you to everyone who's been waiting so patiently, to the awesome RLCraft communities, all the folks helping test things, report bugs, everyone who worked on RLCraft (credited at the end of this changelog) making this update possible, and to my sponsor Bisect Hosting who, without, I wouldn't of had the time to work on RLCraft so much.  I really hope you enjoy this update, there is a lot...and I mean a LOT of new stuff, changed stuff, reworked and overhauled stuff...and should theoretically be a whole new beast for you to conquer.  Enjoy!

IMPORTANT INFO:

    - 2.8.2 Worlds are NOT compatible with 2.9.  If you attempt to update an old world, you will likely run into issues, crashes, and quests not working.
    - USE LATEST FORGE - Due to the recent Log4j exploit found in Java, you will want to use the Forge version ending in 2860 or later!  We recommend latest Forge currently
    - Command blocks must be enabled in server.properties, otherwise villages/structures won’t work
    - IF USING OPTIFINE you can no longer use the E3 version, 2.9 will need version G5 or later.
    - Better Foliage has been updated with shader support.  If your leaves/grass are not waving with your shaders, press F8, go to Shader Configuration, and add 100 to the beginning of the Grass and Leaves block ID, so it should look like 10018 and 10031 (Sildur's currently needs this)
    - The default allocated 3GB's of RAM should still be perfectly fine for 2.9.  You should not allocate more than 4GB's for your client, as this ends up causing Java garbage collection to go wonky (very scientific I know)

===========================================
The TLDR List of major changes and updates:
===========================================

    - Updated to latest Forge to patch Log4j exploit
    - Quests! Over 340 quests for you to explore...or not!  Completely optional :) (alt title: for the completionists out there!)
    - Tough as Nails replaced with our own mod Simple Difficulty (Rough Life...ha get it?) bringing tons of features and enhancements to drinking and thirst, HUD elements, temperature mechanics, and more
    - Taming system, mounts, pets, and saddles completely overhauled
    - Spartan Weaponry received a full rebalance of all weapons, including melee, ranged, and throwing
    - Armor received a full rebalance in how damage reduction is applied to locations and how that reduction is scaled between different tiers of armor
    - All new underground generation revamping caves, caverns, mineshafts, vanilla dungeons, underground biomes, and more...
    - Running into a wall too fast may hurt :)
    - A lot of structures overhauled and revamped
    - Battletowers reworked a ton, new spawn conditions, battletower golem AI overhauled, many more fixes.
    - Lost City dimension completely overhauled
    - Boss progression revamped
    - Locks! That BattleTower loot might be a little harder to get into now >:)
    - Fishing completely overhauled and reworked fishing mechanics and loot!
    - All new parkour mechanics in the forms of new agility skills and new enchantments
    - Nether overhaul, all new sub biomes with new plants and foliage variety + unique structures, building blocks, and unique resources
    - New enchantments, plus many other enchantments reworked
    - New mobs, mob reworks, new models and animations for many mobs
    - Villages pimped out
    - Many dungeon's reworked
    - Antique Atlas revamped with all new textures and icons
    - All new (and old) race rings, now only found in Lost Cities
    - CARPET ON STAAAAAAAAAIRS!!!

    - This changelog is likely incomplete, because after working over a year on this, I literally cannot remember every single thing we've done for 2.9...but it was a hell of a lot lol, so here's what I remember =P

============
Server Info:
============

    - Many performance fixes for servers, to the point where 2.9 server's should no longer require frequent restarts for clearing RAM/cache (restarts still recommended of course just in case but we ran a 2.9 server for 2 weeks straight with no restarts and zero issues, so i think that says somethin' at least =P massive credit to Charles for a ton of the insane performance fixes)

    Server.Properties Settings:
    - NEW: Server's MUST enable "enable-command-block".  Set this to TRUE in your server.properties or structures won't generate correctly and villager spawns will be missing.
    - "allow-flight" must be TRUE for flying mounts, fairy ring, and more, or the server will wrongly kick players.
    - "max-tick-time" must be -1 (that's negative 1) for large structures generating and for pregenning worlds.
    - "difficulty" should be 3 (Hard) for the correct balance and features RLCraft is centered around.

    - Fixed Vespid Hives
    - Fixed several memory leaks
    - Fixed boss altars removing bedrock
    - Fixed many projectiles having "ripper" quality meaning they passed through shields and hit you anyway and were unblockable.  Fixes not being able to block projectiles from: Reaper, Xapahans, Grell, Cinders, Reavers, Astaroths, Quill Beasts, and Serpix's
    - Prime Ember, Aetherwave, Lightball, and Throwing Scythe's will still have "ripper", these are fired from: Sylphs, Clinks, Wisps, and Ignibus


Armor Rebalance!:
    - Armor has been rescaled accordingly so Dragon armor, Tide Guardian armor, and Golem armor no longer all hit the 80% damage reduction cap.  Previously, there was no difference between these armors because they gave you SO much armor, exceeding the reduction cap.
    - Every armor/armor toughness multiplier and offset for Head, Body, Legs, and Feet locations (First Aid) have been modified and rebalanced

    Stats (Multiplier = armor point multiplier per location, Offset = starting armor points:
   - Toughness Multiplier is now 1.0 (was 3.0) across all locations
   - Head Armor Multiplier is now 4.0 (was 6.0)
   - Head Armor Offset is now 3.0 (was 1.0)
   - Chest Armor Multiplier is now 2.0 (was 2.5)
   - Chest Armor Offset is now 3.0 (was 0.0)
   - Legs Armor Multiplier is now 2.0 (was 3.0)
   - Legs Armor Offset is now 4.0 (was 0.0)
   - Feet Armor Multiplier is now 3.0 (was 6.0)
   - Feet Armor Offset is now 3.0 (was 0.0)

   - Overall, multipliers were lowered, so armor scales more smoothly and doesn't hit the 80% reduction cap too quickly, while offsets were raised, making early game armor like leather to armor feel exactly the same, so this mainly affects the later tier armors.

    Example:
   - RLCraft 2.8.2 Head Armor, Multiplier and Offset, was 6 + 1 giving us 7.  Now in RLCraft v2.9, it is 4 + 3, which still gives us 7, meaning Leather armor has not changed, and is still 7 armor points, but won't scale as effectively with each tier of armor as the multiplier is now only 4.
    - "What does this mean for headshots?" Glad you asked.

    Helmets in 2.8.2:
    - Leather Helmet = 7 Locational Armor
    - Chainmail/Iron Helmet = 13 Locational Armor
    - Diamond Helmet = 19 Locational Armor
    - Dragon/Tide Helmet = 25 Locational Armor
    - Golem Helmet = 31 Locational Armor

    How many arrows to the head does it take from a Skeleton to kill you in 2.8.2:
    - Leather Helmet = 2 shots
    - Chainmail/Iron Helmet = 3 shots
    - Diamond Helmet = 6 shots
    - Dragon/Tide Helmet = 8 shots
    - Golem Helmet = 8 shots

    Helmets in 2.9:
    - Leather Helmet = 7 Locational Armor
    - Chainmail/Iron Helmet = 11 Locational Armor
    - Diamond Helmet = 15 Locational Armor
    - Dragon/Tide Helmet = 19 Locational Armor
    - Golem Helmet = 23 Locational Armor

    How many arrows to the head does it take from a Skeleton to kill you in 2.9:
    - Leather Helmet = 2 shots
    - Chainmail/Iron Helmet = 3 shots
    - Diamond Helmet = 4 shots
    - Dragon/Tide Helmet = 6 shots
    - Golem Helmet = 8 shots

    - These were unenchanted with no qualities.  As you can see, the only armors that ended up changing given these testing parameters, were Diamond, Dragon and Tide Guarding armor.  Hope this helps understand the armor rebalance a bit better.
