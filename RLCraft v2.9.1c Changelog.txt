RLCraft v2.9.1c - QoL and Performance Update

2.9.1 b and c hotfix (again...sorry!), fixes baubles and enchantments that effect jump not working, fixes fishing proficiency in levelup breaking with new Fishing Made Better update, fixes filleting stacking issue, fixes crashes with gambling pickaxe:
 
(From initial 2.9 release) This update has been over a year in the making, thank you to everyone who's been waiting so patiently, to the awesome RLCraft communities, all the folks helping test things, report bugs, everyone who worked on RLCraft (credited at the end of this changelog) making this update possible, and to my sponsor Bisect Hosting who, without, I wouldn't of had the time to work on RLCraft so much.  I really hope you enjoy this update, there is a lot...and I mean a LOT of new stuff, changed stuff, reworked and overhauled stuff...and should theoretically be a whole new beast for you to conquer.  Enjoy!

To see all the initial v2.9 changes, please check https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rlcraft/files/3575903

2.9.1 Changes Below:

===============
IMPORTANT INFO:
===============

    - 2.9 Worlds ARE compatible with 2.9.1
    - 2.8.2 Worlds are NOT compatible with 2.9.  If you attempt to update an old world, you will likely run into issues, crashes, and quests not working.
    - USE LATEST FORGE - Due to the recent Log4j exploit found in Java, you will want to use the Forge version ending in 2860 or later!  We recommend latest Forge currently
    - Command blocks must be enabled in server.properties, otherwise villages/structures won’t work
    - IF USING OPTIFINE you can no longer use the E3 version, 2.9 will need version G5 or later.
    - Better Foliage has been updated with shader support.  If your leaves/grass are not waving with your shaders, press F8, go to Shader Configuration, and add 100 to the beginning of the Grass and Leaves block ID, so it should look like 10018 and 10031 (Sildur's currently needs this)
    - The default allocated 3GB's of RAM should still be perfectly fine for 2.9.  You should not allocate more than 4GB's for your client, as this ends up causing Java garbage collection to go wonky (very scientific I know)

============
Server Info:
============

    - Many performance fixes for servers, to the point where 2.9 server's should no longer require frequent restarts for clearing RAM/cache (restarts still recommended of course just in case but we ran a 2.9 server for 2 weeks straight with no restarts and zero issues, so i think that says somethin' at least =P massive credit to Charles for a ton of the insane performance fixes)

    Server.Properties Settings:
    - NEW: Server's MUST enable "enable-command-block".  Set this to TRUE in your server.properties or structures won't generate correctly and villager spawns will be missing.
    - "allow-flight" must be TRUE for flying mounts, fairy ring, and more, or the server will wrongly kick players.
    - "max-tick-time" must be -1 (that's negative 1) for large structures generating and for pregenning worlds.
    - "difficulty" should be 3 (Hard) for the correct balance and features RLCraft is centered around.

    - Performance fixes, added handshake logic to reduce amount of packets required to sync server and client when fishing succeeds/fails/ends etc, cleanup of some imports/warnings in logs

Lycanites:

    - HUGE performance boost! Models now rendered using VBOs and your GPU, significantly improving performance when rendering many Lycanite mobs at a time (mob events should be smooth as butter now :) )
    - Removed credit from summoning pedestal, this way they can't be used for AFK farms anymore, so mobs killed by summoned mobs from the summoning pedestal no longer count as player kills
    - Summoning pedestal now only lasts for 20 seconds with 1 redstone (was 60 seconds per 1 redstone)
    - Summoning pedestal portal and particles effect will turn off once the summoning pedestal runs out of redstone charge

    - Lycanite mobs can spawn on snow layers again yay!

    - Xaphan Spine lvl 2 now deals Penetration lvl 2 (was lvl 1)
    - Ettin club drop chance 5% → 10%
    - Tweaked underground spawner: mobCountMin: 8 → 6; tickRate: 800 → 900; limit: 32 → 24 (essentially underground mob spawns should be toned down a bit)

RLTweaker:

    General:
    - Pathfinding Chunk Cache Fix: Stops ghost chunkloading when creating pathfinding chunk caches

    - Replace Enchantment Handler: Replaces the enchantment handler entirely for performance

    Charm:
    - Disable Magnetic Enchantment: Option to disable the effect of Magnetic without unregistering it to avoid packet issues. Use this if the enchantment is broken.
    - Fix Charged Emerald Crash: Fix charged emeralds crashing when being fired from a dispenser. (thanks Rainy Afternoon)

    Dynamic Surroundings:
    - Environment Service Delay: Delay the environment service for village detection so it runs every second instead of every tick

    Ruins:
    - Remove RUINSTRIGGER Functionality: Removes the command block RUINSTRIGGER feature, as nothing used it and it causes issues with player chunkloading

    Serene Seasons:
    - Replace Random Update Handler: (requires patch chunkTicks) Replaces the random update handler with a faster alternative for performance.

    Spawner Control:
    - Remove World Ticks: Removes world ticks, which are used to create smoke particles and remove obsolete spawners, to save performance.

    Patches:

    Mohist:

    - LootTweaker fix
    - Realbench patch fix

    Sponge:
    - LootTweaker fix
    - Pathfinding Chunk Cache patch is skipped if sponge is detected (skipped regardless of the serverCompatibility setting)


Simple Difficulty (Rough Life):

    - Inspirations Cauldron compatibility, can now drink from cauldrons, fixes for canteens used on cauldrons
    - Tile entities are now separate heat calculations by default (heater + campfire will work now)

Spartan Weaponry:

    - Fixed Throwing Weapon items disappearing when the projectile despawns (meaning trees will stop eating them now lel)
    - Reduced the xp cost for replacing enchanted throwing weapon ammo from 2 levels per enchantment level to 1 level. This should prevent the possibility of replacing ammo for a heavily enchanted throwing weapon being too expensive to work in the Anvil.

    - Added a button to toggle the "Always Show Mana Bar" option in the Race Gui.
    - Changed the Dragons Eye Growl sound to be in the Player sound Category, instead of the "Record" Category
