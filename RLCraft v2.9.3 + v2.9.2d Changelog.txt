(From initial 2.9 release) This update has been over a year in the making, thank you to everyone who's been waiting so patiently, to the awesome RLCraft communities, all the folks helping test things, report bugs, everyone who worked on RLCraft (credited at the end of this changelog) making this update possible, and to my sponsor Bisect Hosting who, without, I wouldn't of had the time to work on RLCraft so much.  I really hope you enjoy this update, there is a lot...and I mean a LOT of new stuff, changed stuff, reworked and overhauled stuff...and should theoretically be a whole new beast for you to conquer.  Enjoy!

===============
IMPORTANT INFO:
===============

    - 2.9 and 2.9.1c Worlds ARE (mostly) compatible with 2.9.2/2.9.3 HOWEVER there are 2 commands you will need to run if you insist on staying on old worlds to update quests and loot tables;
        /bq_admin default load
        /bqs_loot default load
    - You will also need to run "/fml confirm" (for servers only) on first boot, to confirm some item registry changes

    - NOTICE:  If you update from 2.9/2.9.1c to 2.9.2/2.9.3, please note the following:
        - New structures will require new chunks to generate
        - Races will reset and will need to be re-applied
        - JEI will not show enchantment applications correctly (no fix other than new world)
        - There is a slight possibility enchantments ID's may shift, though in our testing, enchantment ID's remained the same
        - If you were wearing a BackPack, all your items will drop on the ground
        - We recommend new worlds, and always make backups

    - IF USING SPONGEFORGE or OPENJ9 please check the "For Servers Only.txt" documentation for further info

    - 2.8.2 Worlds are NOT compatible with 2.9+.  If you attempt to update an old world, you will likely run into issues, crashes, and quests not working.
    - USE LATEST FORGE - Due to the recent Log4j exploit found in Java, you will want to use the Forge version ending in 2860 or later!  We recommend latest Forge currently.
    - Command blocks must be enabled in server.properties, otherwise villages/structures wonâ€™t work.
    - IF USING OPTIFINE you can no longer use the E3 version, 2.9 and up will need version G5 or later.
    - Better Foliage has been updated with shader support.  If your leaves/grass are not waving with your shaders, press F8, go to Shader Configuration, and add 100 to the beginning of the Grass and Leaves block ID, so it should look like 10018 and 10031 (Sildur's currently needs this, other shaders may use different ID's though, such as Complementary Reimagined using 10004 and 10008).
    - The default allocated 3GB's of RAM should still be perfectly fine for 2.9+.  You should not allocate more than 4GB's for your client, as this ends up causing Java garbage collection to go wonky (very scientific I know).

============
Server Info:
============

    - Many performance fixes for servers, to the point where 2.9+ server's should no longer require frequent restarts for clearing RAM/cache (restarts still recommended of course just in case but we ran a 2.9+ server for 2 weeks straight with no restarts and zero issues, so i think that says somethin' at least =P massive credit to Charles for a ton of the insane performance fixes)

    Server.Properties Settings:
    - NEW: Server's MUST enable "enable-command-block".  Set this to TRUE in your server.properties or structures won't generate correctly and villager spawns will be missing.
    - "allow-flight" must be TRUE for flying mounts, fairy ring, and more, or the server will wrongly kick players.
    - "max-tick-time" must be -1 (that's negative 1) for large structures generating and for pregenning worlds.
    - "difficulty" should be 3 (Hard) for the correct balance and features RLCraft is centered around.

    - Atomic Deconstructor now has sound effect and works in off-hand (RLMixins)
    - Plowing I and II now have the proper minimum enchantment, allowing them to be obtained on an Enchanting Table and no longer break Book Wyrms (RLMixins)

    - Crossbows now scale load time and aim time AND bolt speed with higher materials (tooltips updated to reflect these)
    - Fixed damage modifier bugs for throwing weapons where only the most recent damage modifying Weapon Property was being applied and overriding previous ones. This should make Silver and some addon throwing weapons work properly again.
